- Soldering heating instructions should be ~350 C or ~660 F (not 350 F) for 1.5mm solder in the 362 lab.
- Judging by the pictures, the single sided pin headers are only used for the 2x3 pin heads for proton to the debugger
connections, and the double sided headers should be used for everything else. Written instructions for double and single
sided pin headers contradict each other.
- Maybe include some copper wick/desoldering pump instructions in case a student messes up and connects to adjacent pins.
